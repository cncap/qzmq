QZmq
----

Yet another Qt binding for ZeroMQ. It wraps the C API of libzmq.

To build the examples:

  echo "LIBS += -lzmq" > conf.pri
  qmake && make

To include the code in your project, just use the files in src. From a qmake
project you can include src.pri. It's your responsibility to link to libzmq.
